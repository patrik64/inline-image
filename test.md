The risk management process in ISO 14971 revolves around several critical stages:

Risk Management Planning: Developing a detailed strategy to identify, assess, control, and monitor potential risks throughout the entire lifecycle of a medical device, ensuring patient safety and regulatory compliance.
Risk Analysis: Identifying potential hazards related to the medical device, whether from its materials, design, or intended use.
Risk Evaluation: Assessing the probability of occurrence and the severity of the impact if the risk materializes.
Risk Control: Implementing measures to mitigate or reduce risks to an acceptable level.
Residual Risk: Evaluating any remaining risks after implementing control measures and determining whether they are acceptable.
Risk Management Review: Evaluating the effectiveness and completeness of the risk management activities and documentation, ensuring that all risks have been properly identified, mitigated, and are within acceptable levels throughout the device's lifecycle.
Post-Market Surveillance: Continuously monitoring the device in real-world use to identify unforeseen risks or issues that may arise.
Through this process, ISO 14971 ensures that every step, from the initial concept of a medical device to its use in healthcare settings, has been rigorously analyzed for potential hazards.
